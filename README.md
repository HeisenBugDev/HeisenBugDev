# Wut the wut?
HeisenBugDev is a community led website that is hosted by us (similar to rubygems.org) It is meant to be 100% free and developers who put their mod on the system get NO ADS for any of it. It has easy integration with a build system such as Travis-CI or Jenkins so you can automatically publish your builds. It also has a wiki which can have pages tied to a specific version or build of a mod.

# FAQ
**Like CurseForge?**
NO! It is far faster, prettier, and less evil! CurseForge is bloated and run by Curse which doesn't care what you think. HeisenBugDev is built on _your_ ideas!

**Ads suck**
We are going to try to use adsense in a way that doesn't bother you. If you are a developer and put your mod on the website, you will see no ads when you login. Also, we try to give back the money the ads bring in to you.

# Issues and Trello
Trello is meant to be used for tracking the **status** of work on something (has someone started on it? Are we about to? Just an idea? Testing?) whereas the Discourse category (HeisenBugDev) and PRs are for details about that (checklist, dicussions, x needs to be rewritten for y to work, etc).

Here is the Trello board for people who want to see the status of things https://trello.com/b/TSoCaDP5/heisenbugdev
